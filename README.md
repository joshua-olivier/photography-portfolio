If you have any problems, questions, ideas or suggestions for new projects, feel free to send me an e-mail at joshuaolivierr@gmail.com from the contact page on my portfolio.

Disclaimer: Those fake websites, OnlyPans and Lewis & Richmond also contain a contact form. Keep in mind that those fake websites won't send me your e-mails because I didn't include an automatic e-mail sender. Those were for funsies only. Also, I didn't add a favicon because the icon couldn't be displayed on the tab
